# The `RefreshComponent` widget

This file defines `RefreshComponent`, which allows you to have an HTML widget that updates
incrementally as more results are computed by a Lean computation.

For this interaction, we use an `IO.Ref` that the JavaScript reads from.
It stores the HTML that should currently be on display, and a task returning the next HTML.
To determine whether the widget is up to date, each computed HTML has an associated version number.
(So, the `n`-th HTML will have index `n`)

When the widget (re)loads, it first loads the current HTML from the ref, and then
repeatedly awaits further HTML result.

## Known limitations

Cancellation is a bit hard to get right, and there are two limitations.

1. When using a `RefreshComponent` that reacts to shift-clicking in the infoview,
we want to cancel the computation whenever a new selection is made.
We acomplish this in `mkCancelPanelWidget` by creating a reference to a cancel token,
which we can reset every time a new selection is made.
On the other hand, we would also like to cancel the computation if that part of the file gets
reloaded. Unfortunately, the `CoreM` monad can only store up to 1 cancel token at a time.
The result is that if you close the infoview while the widget is active, and then reload
this part of the file, the widget computation keeps running without any way to stop it
(except for restarting the file, or waiting it out)
2. When using a `RefreshComponent` that comes directly from a command/tactic (no shift-clicking),
then we pass the cancel token used by elaboration to the refresh component computation.
Unfortunately there is an edge case where the cancel token gets set while the corresponding
command does not get re-elaborated. In particular, if you have three command in a row, e.g.
```
#html countToTen
#html countToTen
#html countToTen
```
Then commenting out the third command will cancel the widget of the first command.
It refreshes the second command, and doesn't affect commands before the first command - only
the first command gets badly affected.

using `RefreshToken.refresh`. -/
structure RefreshToken where

  If we drop the reference to this structure, and hence to this promise,
  the `next` field will resolve to `none`. -/

    promise := ← IO.mkRef promise }

/-- Update the current HTML to be `html`.
This function makes use of `ST.Ref.take` in order to be thread safe.
That is, if multiple different threads call `RefreshToken.refresh` with the same refresh token,
a call will block other calls until it is finished. -/

/-- Create a `RefreshComponent`. Explicitly support cancellation by creating a cancel token,
and setting the previous cancel token. This is useful when the component depends on the selections
in the goal, so that after making a new selection, the previous computation is cancelled.

Note: The cancel token is only set when a new computation is started.
  When the infoview is closed, this unfortunately doesn't set the cancel token. -/
