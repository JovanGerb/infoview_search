TODO for the induction suggestions:
- make induction using `Quotient.induction_on_pi` work.
- deduplication when multiple recursors do the same thing.
- paste the whole induction tactic including all match arms.
- use `rcases` instead of `cases` for non-case-splitting `cases`.
- that also unlocks the possibility for `rintro` rather than intro
- `rcases h with rfl` can simply be replaced by `subst h`

TODO: add tests for

- You can rewrite with local theorems even if they are a very general match
  (and test that this doesn't work with global theorems).
- The `rw` suggestions only show one of the two directions for lemmas that are the same in
  both directions.
- When it tries to pass arguments explicitly, and this gives an incorrectly located rewrite.
- Test for deduplication logic:
  - numerals in different types are considered different.
  - when instances are different (but defeq), these are considered the same

TODO:

- Note: there are theorems with `Simproc` in the name, which should be excluded.
- Allow a user-defined filter in addition to the blacklist?
- improve `nth_rw` heuristic & add a test. Maybe, there should be a `set_option` that determines
  whether to print arguments explicitly.

- More tactic suggestions
  - `contrapose(!)`/`absurd(!)` on hypothesis and `by_contra(!)` on goal?
  - `ext`, `funext`
  - `congr!`, `gcongr`
  - `infer_instance`, `decide`
  - `by_cases` on the selected proposition, if it is not purely in RHS of `→` or either side of `∧`
  - `specialize`/`use`?
  - `fun_induction`/`fun_cases`?
- The tactics section should be extensible via an attribute.

- Improve the pasting feature: independent of where the cursor is, we want to paste the
  tactic in the correct place.
  This could also include special-casing for
  - the `by` token (i.e. when creating the first tactic in a sequence)
  - the focus dot `· `
  - being inside another tactic combinator, e.g. `induction`, `cases`, `on_goal`

- Detect whether we are in `conv` mode, by detecting the mdata. Though the suggestions seem to
  work mostly fine in conv mode already.
